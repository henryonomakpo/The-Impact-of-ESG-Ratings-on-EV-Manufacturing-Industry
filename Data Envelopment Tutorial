Introduction
Background and Motivation
Efficiency considers the relationship between input and output which under the same input, the higher the output, the higher the efficiency. Therefore, evaluating efficiency is a crucial factor in managing a company for production. In practically production, the true production function is almost impossible to be observed. However, if we don't have the production function, then the efficiency can't be evaluted. Consequently, it must to be propose an approach to estimate the production function for evaluating efficiency.

What is DEA?
DEA is a methodology based on benchmarking techniques, and also a non-paramistics approach by estimating production function from existing data for evaluating the efficiency of comparable entities (Decision making units (DMUs))[5].

Why use DEA?
In practically, production usually is a system of Multi-Input Multi-Output(MIMO) which is almost impossible to formulate even guess the true production function because it has a high dimension of data. DEA is a nonparamic approach which have the benefit of not require to assuming a particular functional shape for the frontier, however it estimating approximately production function with existing data.[2].

Constraints of DEA
The input and output data must be very clear, therefore it can't be the dummy variable or categorical variable, or the evaluation will be biased.
Between the evaluated DMUs are required have "Homogeneity", that is, the different nature or different scale is not advisable to compare the various DMUs of each other.
The result evaluated by DEA is the relative efficiency among the DMUs, not the absolute efficiency, therefore, it is not appropriate to use the estimated "relative efficiency" as an absolute value.
DEA is extremely sensitive to noise of data, therefore, the data to be evaluated should be as correct as possible.
Prerequisite knowledge
Production function
A production function stands for a production frontier which also represents a "maximum outputs" that can be achieved using input vector ùï©. In addition, the data resource as must come from the same industry as possible because the different industry may have different resource consumption proportion and quantity of outputs for technique.
Illustration of Production function

Properties of Production function[1]
Nonnegativity: The production output is a finite, non-negative, real number.
Weak Essentiality: The production output cannot be generated without the use of at least one input.
Monotonicity: Additional units of an input will not decrease output; also called nondecreasing in .
Concavity: Any linear combination of the vectors  and  will produce an output that is no less than the same linear combination of  and . That is , . This property implies the "law of diminishing marginal returns".
Exception
Above properties are not very exhaustive, nor are universally maintained.

Monotonicity is relaxed when the input congestion. e.g. Purchasing more machines will increase productivity, but too many machines will reduce the productivity of the machine due to other external factors
Concavity is relaxed to characterize an S-shaped production function[5]

Variable Returns to Scale
In production(economics), returns to scale describe how change to long run returns as the scale of production increases, when all input levels are variable. The concept of returns to scale arises from a production function of company which explains the linkage of the rate of increase in output (production) relative to associated increases in input (factors of production). In the long run, all factors of production are variable and subject to change in response to a given increase in production scale[4].


There are three possible types of returns to scaleÔºö
Constant returns to scale(CRS) The quantity of increase for output is proportional to the input when it increase the input.
# ConclusionÔºö This is a optimal state for production of company.

Decreasing returns to scale(DRS) The quantity of increase for output is less than the input when it increase the input.
# ConclusionÔºö This state implies that the company is under the too large production scale which is not recommended to increase more input.

Increasing returns to scale(IRS) The quantity of increase for output is larger than the input when it increase the input.
# ConclusionÔºö This state implies that the company is under the too large production scale which is recommended to increase more input.

CRS DEA model
HistoryÔºö
Based on Ferrell's model of measuring efficiency, Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (CCR) propose the CRS DEA model in 1978 which is also called CCR model.

Goal:
Measure "Overall Efficiency (OE)" and identify the "Most Productive Scale Size(MPSS)" of "one specific firm r".

Primal FormulationÔºö
This is a Fractional ProgrammingÔºÅ


This formulation has
‚Äî  decision variables
‚Äî  constraints

Dual FormulationÔºö
Because primal formulation is a fractional programming which is also a nonlinear programming , therefore primal formulation can be transformed to dual formulation by dual theory for simplizing the caculation.



This formulation has
‚Äî  decision variables
‚Äî  constraints

VRS DEA model
HistoryÔºö
Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (BCC) relaxed the assumption of constant returns to scale who propose VRS DEA model in 1984 which is also called BCC model.

Goal:
Measure "Technical Efficiency (TE)" of "one specific firm r".

Primal FormulationÔºö


Dual FormulationÔºö



How to evaluate the efficiency?
Input-Oriented Model
As shown below, the point of  is the current state of input and the point of  is the optimal state of the input. Accordingly, The idea of input-oriented model is to "proportionally reduce the quantities of input without changing the quantities output".


Output-Oriented Model
As shown below, the point of  is the current state of output and the point of  is the optimal state of the output. Accordingly, The idea of output-oriented model is to "proportionally expand the quantities of output without altering the quantities input".


Decomposing the Overall Efficiency
ComponentÔºö
Overall Efficiency(OE) is the optimal solution() of CRS DEA model.
Technical Efficiency(TE) is the optimal solution() of VRS DEA model.
Scale Efficiency (SE) can be calculate by dividing the  by the . In addition, economic scale affects the productivity of a firm, then a firm would like to achieve "economic scale" to reduce the production cost.

    } for i in I
}

}
with open('airlines_data.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    rows = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    k = 0
    for row in rows:

        for j in J:
            Y[j][K[k]] = float(row[j])
        k += 1
Step. 4
In this case, I use dual formulation and input-oriented model to implement the CRS DEA model.

Building the model
model = LpProblem('CRS_model', LpMinimize)
Building the decision variables  and .
theta_r = LpVariable(f'theta_r')

    model += lpSum([
            lambda_k[k] * X[i][k]
        for k in K]) <= theta_r * float(X[i][K[r]])
for j in J:
    model += lpSum([
            lambda_k[k] * Y[j][k]
        for k in K]) >= float(Y[j][K[r]])
Solving the model
model.solve()
Step. 5
In this case, I use dual formulation and input-oriented model to implement the VRS DEA model.

Building the model
model = LpProblem('VRS_model', LpMinimize)
Building the decision variables  and .

Solving the model
model.solve()
Step. 6
Call the function for output.

OE_outputText = 'These are OE of all DMUs\n-------------\n'
TE_outputText = 'These are TE of all DMUs\n-------------\n'
SE_outputText = 'These are SE of all DMUs\n-------------\n'

for k in range(len(K)):
    OE_text, OE_val = getOverallEfficiency(k)
    TE_text, TE_val = getTechnicalEfficiency(k)
    OE_outputText += OE_text
    TE_outputText += TE_text
    SE_outputText += f'{K[k]}Ôºö{round(OE_val / TE_val, 3)}\n'
print(OE_outputText)
print(TE_outputText)
print(SE_outputText)
Result
We found that DMUs of C, G, H, I, K and L are in a better efficiency state then the DMUs of D, J and M are in a poor efficiency state from this table, which suggest to the DMUs of D and J can decompose the SE with input and output data for understanding and improving the poor efficiency state.

Comments
DEA is a robust technique for evaluating efficiency when I want to know that how to benchmark the different airlines or branches of the bank. This technique is suitable for executive or analyst in any industry that needs to evaluate the efficiency of homogeneous units , which especially in manufacturing. During apply the DEA model, the units can be compare each other by relative efficiency but it can't tell us how to improve the efficiency. As a result, it need to apply another apporch for finding out the solution of improvement because DEA just a tool for evaluating relative efficiency of each units.
